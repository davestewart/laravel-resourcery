# Laravel Resourcery

## A lightweight & flexible resource management system

Resourcery is an integrated set of services, classes, views and language config that bridges the gap between CRUD-generation libraries and a full CMS.

The package flexibly handles all aspects of the resource flow:

- Controller logic
- Database interaction
- View generation
- Form generation
- Validation
- User feedback
- Localisation

Resourcery allows you not only to get up and running fast with new resources in the same way that CRUD generation does, but also allows you to remain dynamic, in the same way that a CMS might.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/davestewart/laravel-resourcery/wiki) for full documentation and user guides.
